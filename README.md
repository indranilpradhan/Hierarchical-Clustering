# Hierarchical-Clustering

1. Cluster the data using any Agglomerative(bottom-up strategy) method of your choice.
2. Cluster the data using any divisive hierarchical clustering method (top-down strategy).
3. Plot a dendrogram for both. Compare the clusters formed by both and analyse the
clusters formed.
